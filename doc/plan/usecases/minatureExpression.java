/**
 * IF greater 2 1 [ fd 50]
 * <p>
 * Command passed from the view to the parser
 * <p>
 * The parser recognizes that the IF needs a single number
 * <p>
 * Recognizes that greater needs 2 arguments
 * <p>
 * The next two arguments are given to a greater command, which is executed and the result is given
 * to the if command which is executed
 * <p>
 * If the if command is nonzero, then the forward 50 is acted on the turtle

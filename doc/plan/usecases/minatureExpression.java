/**
 IF greater 2 1 [ fd 50]

 Command passed from the view to the parser

 The parser recognizes that the IF needs a single number

 Recognizes that greater needs 2 arguments

 The next two arguments are given to a greater command, which is executed and the result is given
 to the if command which is executed

 If the if command is nonzero, then the forward 50 is acted on the turtle
